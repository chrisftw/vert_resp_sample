Sample code as requested by Vertical Response.

Requirements:

This request is optional and the candidate should spend no more than 2 hours on this -- we would like to discourage candidates from spending unnecessary time polishing the code to perfection as this is only going to be used as a tool to ask questions in the interview. Ideally, the candidate would have a separate source code commit for each of the individual steps.
1. Create a simple String calculator with a method Add(numbers) that takes a string
2. The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum (for an empty string it will return 0) for example “” or “1” or “1,2”
3. Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to 1 and two numbers
4. Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers
5. Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).
6. the following input is ok: “1\n2,3” (will equal 6)
7. the following input is NOT ok: “1,\n”
8. Make sure you only test for correct inputs. there is no need to test for invalid inputs
9. Allow the Add method to handle a different delimiter:
10. to change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: “//[delimiter]\n[numbers…]” for example “//;\n1;2” should return three where the default delimiter is ‘;’ .
11. the first line is optional. all existing scenarios should still be supported
12. Calling Add with a negative number will throw an exception “negatives not allowed” – and the negative that was passed.if there are multiple negatives, show all of them in the exception message"
